__Prelim questions__

1. Have you deleted any Waze data that you downloaded onto your computer (answer this at the end of the problem set in the affirmative)?    

    
# Waze data start-up (5 points)

Working with data on a server adds a challenge as you have to make calls to 
the database which take time to process. A call to the database can be slow for 
several reasons. 

1) the data you are trying to pull is very large. 
1) many people 
are making requests at the same time. 
1) something else is going on. 

We can adjust for 1 and 2 by testing our code on small subsections of the data. 

Next week we will provide an opt out where you can use `csv` we provide.
Using this option will result in a 10 percent discount on your problem set 
final grade. For example, if you earn $90$ pts based on your solutions, 
your final grade will be $90 \cdot .9 = 81$.

1. Which of the following methods will cause problems as you develop your 
  solutions?
    a. Use `filter()` to reduce the amount of data you pull while exploring data.
       For example, you can filter by time and location to only get data for a 
       small part of the city and/or over a short time period.
    a. `collect()` a small sample data set so that the you have data in memory on your     
       computer.
    a. `collect()` the entire data set each time you want to work with it.

1. As is the case with any data set, Waze has to make decisions about what data
  to store and how to measure it. Review the data documentation and the rest of 
  the problem set. Propose a variable that Waze could feasibly track that is not 
  available now or feasible and better way a to measure a variable currently in 
  the dataset. Support your proposal with reasoning.

1. As is the case with most consumer data, Waze users are self-selecting. Write a 
  few detailed sentences about how you think self-selection influences what data 
  is present. 
    
    
# Waze vision zero (15 points)

Read up on the `ggmap` package, which will be useful for doing these problems.
Particularly, get to know the `get_stamenmap()` function. If you find yourself 
downloading 1000s of tiles, check your settings. You are welcome to try using
google basemaps as well; while free for new users, this will require a credit
card. The version of `ggmap` on CRAN is out of date, instead find and install it 
from github.

1.  Look at Vision Zero Neighborhood High Crash Corridor #7. Plot the accidents in 
    this corridor on a map. 
    
Vision Zero Neighborhood High Crash Cooridor #7 is from George to Chicago along Western Ave. 
    
```{r}
?ggmap
?get_stamenmap

chi_vector <- c(left = -87.725,
                bottom = 41.88,
                right = -87.66,
                top = 41.94)

chi_stamenmap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = chi_vector,
                               zoom = 13,
                               maptype = "terrain")
map1 <- ggmap(chi_stamenmap)+
  geom_point(data = chi_a, mapping = aes(x = location_x, y=location_y))
map1
#map with no points on it

chi_a <- chi_a%>%
  filter(between(location_y, 41.895759, 41.933964),
         str_detect(street, "N Western Ave"))
#making the dataframe more specific 




```

1.  Around what intersection are accidents most common? Use Google Street View to lookat this intersection. Do you see any problems?

The intersection that seems to be causing the most issue on Western is Western and Charleston. The data frame suggests this is because of a pot hole. However, on google street view, I cannot locate the pot hole they are referencing.
```{r}
intersection <- chi_a%>%
  group_by(location_y)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
intersection


```
    

# Transit Oriented Development (15 points)

1. On October 21, the City of Chicago [declared](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2018/october/5Million_TransitOriented_Development_HighRidership_Bus_Corridors.html) the 79 and 66 bus routes as areas 
  of focus for transit oriented development. The City says the plan addresses bus
  "slow zones". 
  Note: Watch out for "179th St". 
  
    a. For each corridor, plot traffic alerts by time of day.
    
The time that has the most observations is 3:15 for the 79 bus. For the 66 bus, the observations are mostly happening between 11pm and 12am. 
    
```{r}
chi_b <- chi_sql%>%
  filter(city == "Chicago, IL")%>%
  filter(between(location_x, -87.741481, -87.548168),
str_detect(street, "79"))%>%
  collect()
#79th street, time not split

chi_b_time <- chi_b%>%
  separate(scrape_dt, into = c("date", "time"), sep = " ")%>%
  group_by(time)%>%
  filter(type == "JAM"|
         type == "ACCIDENT")%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=time, y=n))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Time of Day", y= "Number of Alerts (Jams and Accidents)", title = "Number of Alerts by Time of Day for Bus Route 79")

chi_b_time

```

```{r}
chi_c <- chi_sql%>%
  filter(city == "Chicago, IL")%>%
  filter(between(location_x, -87.775126, -87.617101),
         str_detect(street, "Chicago Ave"))%>%
  collect()
#bus 66 - Chicago to austin

chi_c_time <- chi_c%>%
    separate(scrape_dt, into = c("date", "time"), sep = " ")%>%
  group_by(time)%>%
  filter(type == "JAM"|
         type == "ACCIDENT")%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=time, y=n))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Time of Day", y= "Number of Alerts (Jams and Accidents)", title = "Number of Alerts by Time of Day for Bus Route 66")
chi_c_time

```
    
    b. Using a reasoned approach, choose two additional corridors for comparison.
          i. What corridors did you choose and why?
          
For this, I decided to cross-reference the Vision Zero Plan and the Chicago Transit Development Rules website to find two corridors to compare. I picked 55th Garfield, which is corridor 22 on the Vision Zero Plan and also Ashland Avenue, corridor 10. These were both listed as high crash corridors and also as part of the Transit of Development. (https://www.map-strategies.com/blog/2019/1/24/chicagos-transit-oriented-development-rules-have-been-extended-to-bus-routes)
         
          ii. Make comparison plots.
          
          
```{r}
#corridor 22 - Garfield Blvd - Halsted to King
chi_d <- chi_sql%>%
  filter(city == "Chicago, IL")%>%
  filter(between(location_x, -87.645313, -87.615983),
         str_detect(street, "Garfield"))%>%
  collect()

chi_d_time <- chi_d%>%
    separate(scrape_dt, into = c("date", "time"), sep = " ")%>%
  group_by(time)%>%
  filter(type == "JAM"|
         type == "ACCIDENT")%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=time, y=n))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Time of Day", y= "Number of Alerts (Jams and Accidents)", title = "Number of Alerts by Time of Day for Corridor 22")
chi_d_time

```

```{r}
#corridor 10 - Ashland - Fullerton to Van Buren
chi_e <- chi_sql%>%
  filter(city == "Chicago, IL")%>%
  filter(between(location_y, 41.876369, 41.925189),
         str_detect(street, "Ashland"))%>%
  collect()

chi_e_time <- chi_e%>%
    separate(scrape_dt, into = c("date", "time"), sep = " ")%>%
  group_by(time)%>%
  filter(type == "JAM"|
         type == "ACCIDENT")%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=time, y=n))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x = "Time of Day", y= "Number of Alerts (Jams and Accidents)", title = "Number of Alerts by Time of Day for Corridor 10")
chi_e_time

```
    c. Looking beyond traffic, what other alerts are very common in this area? 
      Do you think these alerts would slow down the 66 / 79? If so, what steps 
      could the City take to address the issues?
      
```{r}


```
      
# Waze single event (20 point)

1.  Revisit the event which caused c5a73cc6-5242-3172-be5a-cf8990d70cb2. 

    a. Define a bounding box around the cause of the event. 
    
```{r}

```
    
    a. What causes all these jams? Some googling might help.
    
    a. Plot the number of jams 6AM-6PM CST. Why are there two humps? 
    
```{r}

```
    
    a. Place one vertical line at each hump. 
    
```{r}

```
    
    a. Next, propose a quantitative measure of traffic jam severity that combines 
    the number of traffic `JAM` alerts with information in the `subtype` variable. 
    
```{r}

```
    
    a. Plot this measure from 6AM-6PM CST. Is there any information that is 
    conveyed by your severity measure that was not captured by plotting the number 
    of jams? If so, what is it?
    
```{r}

```
    
    
# Waze aggregate over multiple events (30 points)

1.  Pick one major accident. What is the uuid? Sample alerts from the two hours 
    before the accident first appeared in the data and two hours after the accident 
    for a geographic box of 0.1 miles around the accident. Make a plot where the y-axis
    is the number of traffic jam alerts and the x-axis is the five-minute interval from 
    two hours before the accident to two hours after the accident.  Warning:
    This question is harder than it first appears. You might want to review R4DS chapter 12.5 (lecture note 5) on missing values and chapter 16.4 (lecture note 9). 

```{r}

```

1.  Building on your work for the prior question, write a function that takes as its 
    arguments `uuid`, a `date-time`, a latitude and a longitude and returns a data 
    frame with the number of alerts in each five-minute interval from two hours before to 
    two hours after.
    
```{r}

```
    
1.  Make a data frame with every major accident on Nov 20, 2017. 
    Feed each row of this data frame to your function. Collapse the output into the mean number 
    of traffic jam alerts in each five-minute interval in the two hours before the 
    accident and two hours after the accident for a geographic box of 0.1 miles. 
    Tip: This may take upwards of 20 minutes to run on all major accidents. Use your function on a small sample of
    accidents first to make sure your code is working as expected before trying to run on all accidents. 
    
```{r}

```
    
1.  Plot the mean number of jam alerts around major accident. To be clear, the correct
    answer here is a single plot that summarizes jams across major accidents, not one 
    plot for each accident. Congratulations! This is your first event study.
